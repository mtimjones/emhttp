
This subdirectory contains the internal file system creation tool.

First, a subdirectory is created that contains the particular content (such
as the ./root subdirectory contained here).  Then the ./buildfs tool is run
specifying the "full" pathname with the -s option.  The result is a file
called 'filedata.c' which represents a compilable form of the filesystem
provided.  This file can then be copied to the emhttp build subdirectory
and the server built to bind with the internal file system.
